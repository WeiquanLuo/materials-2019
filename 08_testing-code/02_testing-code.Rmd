# Unit Testing

---

## Unit tests

_"Unit" tests_ are tests that evaluate one feature of a function

_Test Driven Development_ is an approach to programming where the unit tests are written before the actual code

- Requirements are decided in advance

- Code must meet the requirements (and only the requirements)

- Like anything, TDD can be taken to an extreme

---

## Unit tests

For a bit of extra work, you get: 

- Fewer bugs
    - Essential functions are tested and issues are caught quickly
    - Visual confirmation that essential features are working
    - When debugging, write a test to pinpoint the bug (and stop it from reoccurring)

- Better code structure
    - Unit testing encourages modular code with functions that do only one thing
    - Easier to document functions when you're writing them to meet tests

- Robust code 
    - make big changes quickly and without downstream problems
    - Any changes that break things should be caught with tests

- (in theory) Easier restarts - pick up at the last failed test and write code to satisfy that test

---

## Unit tests

- Modular (by design)

- Tests should run quickly

- Each test (or set of tests) is run in a clean environment

- Set-up and Tear-down tasks are used to set up environments for testing

- Should not depend on outside files (traditionally)
        

---

## Unit tests

> But, we're statisticians. What about the data?

- use tiny test data (`dput()` is helpful)

- read in toy data from files in the test directory

- use data included with the package

- use data included in base R

- download data from elsewhere with a set-up function, delete it with a tear-down function
    - tests will fail without internet or if the site is down

## Tools

The `testthat` package provides a framework for unit tests if you are working within a package. 
.small[[This github issue](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/659) has a good discussion of testing outside of the package framework]

```{r, eval = 2}
install.packages("testthat")
library(testthat)
```

### Optional

- `usethis`: help with setting up testing and continuous integration (later)
- `testthis`: RStudio addins to make testing easier.
- `covr`: reports on how much of your code is covered by tests
- `visualTest`[(on Github)](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/visualTest) or `vdiffr`:  testing graphical output

## Trivial Example

Function: `mean(x, na.rm)`

Important behaviors: 

--

- issue a warning or error when x is not numeric (or if x cannot be coerced to a numeric vector)

--

- return a single numeric value equal to sum(x)/length(x)
    - when x has no NA values
    - when x is numeric and na.rm = T

--

- return NA when x has NAs and na.rm = F

---

## Trivial Example Tests

Important behaviors: 

- issue an error when x is not numeric (or if x cannot be coerced to a numeric vector)
```{r}
x <- letters[1:3]
mean(x)
expect_warning(mean(x)) # This is the minimal test
expect_warning(mean(x), # This tests for a specific warning
               "argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA") 
```

---

## Trivial Example Tests

Important behaviors: 
- return a single numeric value equal to sum(x)/length(x)

```{r}
x <- 1:8
y <- c(1:8, NA)
z <- c(T, F)

# Test that mean(1:8) returns a numerically correct response
expect_equal(mean(x), 4.5)

# Test that mean(c(T, F)) returns 0.5
expect_equal(mean(z), 0.5)

# Test that mean(c(1:8, NA)) equals mean(1:8) when na.rm = T
expect_equal(mean(y, na.rm = T), mean(x))
```

---

## Trivial Example Tests

- return NA when na.rm = F and x has NAs
```{r}
# Can also test to see if a test fails...
expect_failure(
  expect_equal(mean(c(1:8, NA), na.rm = F), mean(c(1:8)))
)

# Or test if something returns NA
expect_true(is.na(mean(c(1:8, NA))))
```

## Your Turn

- Function specifications: 
    - name: `sign_root`
    - Parameters n and value, both numeric
        - Function should error if `n` or `value` is not numeric
    - Function should return a number 
        - with the same sign as `value`
        - with magnitude equal to the `n`th root of `value`.

1. Write the tests for this function

2. Write the function and upload to https://gist.github.com/

3. Use your tests on your neighbor's function - do they pass?

---

## Testing in R

Rstudio integrates with `testthat` and makes it easy to run your tests after each change in the code.

---

## Beyond Unit Tests

Unit tests only examine a single function; a package is a group of functions working together. 

_Integration tests_ look at how functions work together to perform a task.

_Functional tests_ look at the whole package

## Example: Types of Testing
.left-column[
![Flour](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/All-Purpose_Flour_%284107895947%29.jpg)
]
.right-column[
Unit tests: 

- salt is salty
- yeast is alive
- water behaves as expected (freezes at 0<span>&#176;</span> C, boils at 100<span>&#176;</span>C)
- flour has correct gluten, texture, composition
- oven turns on and can reach the correct temperature

]


---

## Example: Types of Testing

.left-column[
![Dough rising](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/6/66/20100215172032%21Breaddough1.jpg)

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
![Bread picture](https://c.pxhere.com/photos/ab/fc/bread_baguette_eat_food_baked_goods_delicious_white_bread_bake-830372.jpg!d)

]
.right-column[


Integration tests:

- Yeast dissolves in water (yeast + water)

- Adding flour to yeast and water causes the yeast to grow and bubble (flour + yeast + water)

- Kneading the dough causes gluten to develop properly (action + dough)

- Dough rises (dough + oven)


Functional test:

- Bread is tasty (bread + user)
]

---

## Limitations

- Can't test every possible input combination in most applications

- It's hard to create realistic tests

- Unit testing alone is not sufficient - must test integration and how actual humans use the software

- High-level testing (integration, functional) is hard to automate and requires human intervention

- Version control is essential to this process - track tests and changes

---

## Code Coverage

> How many unit tests are enough?

- `covr` is a package that will:
    1. build your package in a clean environment 
    2. run your tests
    3. determine how many times each line was evaluated (through [magic](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covr/vignettes/how_it_works.html))
    4. launch a Shiny app to show you line-by-line coverage reports
    
- 100% coverage is good, but unit tests aren't everything
    - Some lines aren't worth testing
    - Integration testing matters too!


---

## Continuous Integration

Running tests after every slight change can be tedious.

--

What if we automate it?

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) can be used with github to automatically 
1. set up a test environment
2. install all dependencies
3. build your package
4. run all tests
5. (optional) calculate code coverage and upload to a service like [codecov.io](https://codecove.io)

---

## Continuous Integration

Setting up Travis for your R package:

1. [Make an account](https://travis-ci.org/) and link to your GitHub account
2. Switch Travis monitoring on [for the repository of your choice](https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories)
![:scale 60%](switch_travis_repo_on.png)

---

## Continuous Integration

Setting up Travis for your R package:

1. [Make an account](https://travis-ci.org/) and link to your GitHub account
2. Switch Travis monitoring on [for the repository of your choice](https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories)
3. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your repository: `devtools::use_travis()`
4. Add .travis.yml to .Rbuildignore

A new build will be triggered when you push changes to your github repository.

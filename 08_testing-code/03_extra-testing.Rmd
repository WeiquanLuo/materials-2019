## Beyond Unit Tests

Unit tests only examine a single function; a package is a group of functions working together. 

_Integration tests_ look at how functions work together to perform a task.

_Functional tests_ look at the whole package

## Example: Types of Testing

![Flour](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/All-Purpose_Flour_%284107895947%29.jpg)
]
.right-column[
Unit tests: 

- salt is salty
- yeast is alive
- water behaves as expected (freezes at 0<span>&#176;</span> C, boils at 100<span>&#176;</span>C)
- flour has correct gluten, texture, composition
- oven turns on and can reach the correct temperature

Integration tests:

- Yeast dissolves in water (yeast + water)

- Adding flour to yeast and water causes the yeast to grow and bubble (flour + yeast + water)

- Kneading the dough causes gluten to develop properly (action + dough)

- Dough rises (dough + oven)


Functional test:

- Bread is tasty (bread + user)

## Limitations

- Can't test every possible input combination in most applications

- It's hard to create realistic tests

- Unit testing alone is not sufficient - must test integration and how actual humans use the software

- High-level testing (integration, functional) is hard to automate and requires human intervention

- Version control is essential to this process - track tests and changes

## Outline

- Another way of setting up a package

- data in packages

- code examples in the help file

Resource: [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan

## Your Turn

`usethis` is a package to help with organizing your workflow in packages and non-package projects

Read through the [README](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) site of `usethis`.

Create a new package using `usethis` functionality. Make sure to not use `tempdir()` as the location for the new package, but a more suitable location.

Use `usethis` functionality to set up a README.Rmd file and a NEWS.md file.

## Your Turn

The `usethis` package allows you to directly connect a project to git and github

1. Check with `use_git_config()` that your user name and email are correct for qorking with github

2. Use `edit_git_config` is they are not correct and fix the information in the file

3. Then use `use_github()` - most likely this will result in an error, unless you have set up a token. Follow the instructions, restart R and try again. 

4. Go to your github page and check whether the new repo is there ...

## Data in a package

- Data frames must be stored in the `data` folder using the command `save`.

- Data the `usethis` way:

```
use_data
function (..., internal = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE, compress = "bzip2")
```

`use_data` places a data object into the `data` folder.

internal data (used by the package not by the users of a package) is placed in the file `sysdata.rda`

## Data documentation

- Documenting data in packages: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#documenting-data

```
#' Prices of 50,000 round cut diamonds.
#'
#' A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000
#' diamonds.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{price}{price, in US dollars}
#'   \item{carat}{weight of the diamond, in carats}
#'   ...
#' }
#' @source \url{http://www.diamondse.info/}
"diamonds"
```


General convention is to have a `data.r` file in the folder R that consists of data documentation.

# Examples in packages

- The Roxygen tag `@examples` allows you to write code as an example in the help file.

- Always make use of this feature! It is not only good practice, it is also a first step in checking that your package is running properly

- Your example has to be **stand alone**, i.e. if you are using some data, it needs to be included in the package.

```
#' @examples
#' # you can include comments
#' x <- 1
#' 5*x
#' hello("this is a test")
```

---

# Package website

The package `pkgdown` creates web pages based on all the files in a package

`pkgdown` supports making websites for your package (see e.g. [x3ptools](https://heike.github.io/x3ptools/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), ... and soon yours)

Process:

```
pkgdown::build_site()
```


Assuming your package has a github repo, add the `docs` folder to the repo 

In `Settings` for your repo, switch GitHub Pages to the docs folder (see screenshot)

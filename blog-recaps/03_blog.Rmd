# Ethics of Reproducibility
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

1. not being able to reproduce results holds science back

--

  - best case scenario: published results are correct - but can't be reproduced because of accessibility issues 

  - worst case scenario: published results are incorrect - might steer the field in a wrong direction

  - either way: loss of resources spent (on trying) to reproduce results that could be spent on new discoveries

--

2. It is our **responsibility** to ensure that our research results are reproducible

--
3. The only choice we have in the matter is "how do we ensure reproducibility?"

# Ten simple rules

 by [Sandve et al](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)


1. For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced

2. Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps

3. Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used

4. Version Control All Custom Scripts

5. Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats

6. For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds

7. Always Store Raw Data behind Plots

8. Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected

9. Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results

10.  Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results

## Generally

- ALL of these rules help with (computation) reproducibility

- When do we  follow rules? - when it's easy!

- Whenever things are (technically) difficult, or we have to be super disciplined, rules fall to the side

- Some rules are impossible to follow because of other constraints out of our control

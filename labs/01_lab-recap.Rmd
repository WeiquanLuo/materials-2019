# Issues with building the book

0. Old R versions 

1. Tons of packages to install

    Weiquan Luo has written a [script](Libraryscrapping.R) that allows to install all necessary libraries needed in a folder. `r emo::ji("pray")` `r emo::ji("pray")` `r emo::ji("pray")`

2. Some issue with the availability of a C compiler. Particularly on Windows machines it is not easy to navigate through the necessary tools to compile a package from source. 

    "Fixes" to this problem is to set the code chunk option `error` to `TRUE` - this will not stop the evaluation, even if an error occurs

    Alternatively, we can comment out pieces in the code that cause an error.

# Weather stations

## Issues


`UTC_offset` is the variable containing the time zones - if you use that variable, the problem is much simpler. 
It was not my intent to mislead you. 


What does this command do?

`weather%>%filter(grepl("AMES", weather$NAME))`

## Next Lab


Well done! 

The next lab is scheduled for Feb 20 (next week Wednesday)

We will cover lists and functions in a spatial setting

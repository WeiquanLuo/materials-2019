# Issues with building the book

0. Old R versions 

1. Tons of packages to install

Weiquan Luo has written a [script](Libraryscrapping.R) that allows to install all necessary libraries needed in a folder. `r emo::ji("pray")` `r emo::ji("pray")` `r emo::ji("pray")`

2. Some issue with the availability of a C compiler. Particularly on Windows machines it is not easy to navigate through the necessary tools to compile a package from source.

`UTC_offset` is the variable containing the time zones - if you use that variable, the problem is much simpler.
